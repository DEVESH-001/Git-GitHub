## Git

- Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase over time. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing changes and merging contributions from different sources.

- Key features of Git include:
  - Distributed version control: Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, allowing for offline work and faster operations.
  - Branching and merging: Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently, and later merge them back into the main codebase.
  - Commit history: Git maintains a detailed history of changes, allowing developers to review and revert to previous versions if needed.
  - Collaboration: Git supports collaboration through platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, enabling code sharing and team workflows.

- Git Commands:

- ls -la: List all hidden files in the current directory.
- git status: Show the current status of the repository, including changes to be committed, untracked files, and modified files.
- commit : its liks a check-point, it saves the current state of the project.
